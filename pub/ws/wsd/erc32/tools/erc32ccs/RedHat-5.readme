The linux version of erc32ccs is compiled on slakware linux using libc5
libraries. Unfortunately, RedHat linux and some versions of Debian
might contain outdated libc5 libraries which causes the compiler to
fail. The file libc5.tar.gz contains libc5 libraries that should
work with erc32ccs. To install them on a Redhat system, do as follows:

cd /usr/i486-linux-libc5/lib
tar xzvf redhat-libc5.tar.gz
/sbin/ldconfig -v
