improving the verification of microprocessors; program-less verification, and methods for handling large differences in 
abstraction level between a reference model and the actual design. Program-less verification is a type of pseudo 
random verification where the notion of a software program executing on the microprocessor has been abandoned. This 
paper will be presented at the VHDL Users' Forum in Europe in Lausanne (CH), September 1998.</FONT></P>

radiation tolerant Advanced GPS GLONASS ASIC, the AGGA-2, implementing the core digital signal processing for 
combined GPS and GLONASS receivers. The AGGA-2 supports a wide range of space related applications, both for 
single-frequency (C/A- code) and dual-frequency (both C/A- and P-code) receivers. The paper describes the principles 
of GPS operation, followed by a list of applications supported by the AGGA-2, typical receiver configurations and an

Front End (PDFE) ASIC together with an 8052 based microcontroller forms a chip set being developed by the European 
Space Agency (ESA) for compact low cost scientific energetic particle instrumentation. Driving requirements of low 
noise and power consumption led to the selection of a single configurable analogue channel followed by an internal 8-bit 
ADC. Low mass and volume necessitated for space applications require on-chip integration of supporting functions such 
as discriminators, independent coincidence event detection and an efficient serial control interface. This paper was 
presented at the 8th European Symposium on Semiconductor Detectors in Schloss Elmau (G), June 1998.</FONT></P>
