prog2mif         "Program to MIF (FrameMaker Interchange Format)" translator:
                 Pretty printer for several languages, converts an ASCII
                 source file to a FrameMaker MIF file. Italicizes comments,
                 boldens key words. Does NOT reformat the text for indentation.
                 Supports ADA, C, C++, LISP, OBJC, M, PERL, PROTEL, SH, Verilog 
                 and VHDL. Requires the perl utility to run (available from 
                 e.g. ftp.uu.net in /languages/perl).

s2m-v8.2.tar     "Synopsys to Mentor" translator:
                 The script converts a Synopsys generated EDIF netlist into 
                 the Mentor Eddm format using the Mentor Netlist Processor
                 (np, bundled with AutoLogic). The schematics are recreated 
                 using the schematic generator (sg). The translator works
                 with libraries from ABB Hafo, GPS, MHS and Actel. Adding 
                 additional libraries is straightforward.
                 For version 8.2.

s2m-v8.4.tar     "Synopsys to Mentor" translator:
                 Same as above, but for version 8.4.
